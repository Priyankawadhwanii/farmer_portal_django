        <div class="prose prose-lg text-gray-700">
            <p class="mb-4">Founded in 2023, Farmer Portal was born from a simple idea: to create a direct bridge between local farmers and consumers. We witnessed the challenges farmers faced with traditional supply chains and the desire of families to access fresh, traceable, and sustainably grown food.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Our platform empowers farmers by giving them a direct storefront to showcase their harvest, set fair prices, and build relationships with their customers. For you, it means unparalleled freshness, transparency about where your food comes from, and the satisfaction of supporting local agriculture.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-farm-green mt-8 mb-4">Our Mission</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">To strengthen local food systems, ensure the economic viability of small-scale farms, and provide our community with the highest quality fresh produce, straight from the soil to your home.</p>
